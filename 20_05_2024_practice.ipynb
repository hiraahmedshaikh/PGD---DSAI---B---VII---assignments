        "This Python code snippet takes an integer input from the user, evaluates certain conditions based on the value of the integer, and prints a corresponding message. Let's break down the code step by step:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Reading:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   n = int(input().strip())\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - This line reads an integer from the user input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace (although unnecessary in this context as `int()` conversion already handles whitespace), and assigns it to the variable `n`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Condition Check for Odd Number:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   if n % 2 != 0:\n",
        "       print(\"Weird\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - This condition checks if `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. If `n` divided by 2 leaves a remainder (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`), it means `n` is odd.\n",
        "   - If `n` is odd, the program prints \"Weird\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Condition Check for Even Numbers:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "       if n >= 2 and n <= 5:\n",
        "           print(\"Not Weird\")\n",
        "       elif n >= 6 and n <= 20:\n",
        "           print(\"Weird\")\n",
        "       elif n > 20:\n",
        "           print(\"Not Weird\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   - If `n` is not odd (i.e., it is even), the program enters the `else` block.\n",
        "   - The program then checks a series of conditions to determine the appropriate output for even numbers:\n",
        "     - **First Condition (`n` between 2 and 5 inclusive):**\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       if n >= 2 and n <= 5:\n",
        "           print(\"Not Weird\")\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "       - If `n` is between 2 and 5 inclusive, it prints \"Not Weird\".\n",
        "     - **Second Condition (`n` between 6 and 20 inclusive):**\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       elif n >= 6 and n <= 20:\n",
        "           print(\"Weird\")\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "       - If `n` is between 6 and 20 inclusive, it prints \"Weird\".\n",
        "     - **Third Condition (`n` greater than 20):**\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       elif n > 20:\n",
        "           print(\"Not Weird\")\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "       - If `n` is greater than 20, it prints \"Not Weird\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- The program categorizes the integer `n` as \"Weird\" or \"Not Weird\" based on its parity (odd or even) and specific ranges for even numbers:\n",
        "  - Odd numbers always result in \"Weird\".\n",
        "  - Even numbers between 2 and 5 result in \"Not Weird\".\n",
        "  - Even numbers between 6 and 20 result in \"Weird\".\n",
        "  - Even numbers greater than 20 result in \"Not Weird\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Runs:\n",
        "1. **Input: 3**\n",
        "   - 3 is odd.\n",
        "   - Output: \"Weird\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input: 4**\n",
        "   - 4 is even and between 2 and 5.\n",
        "   - Output: \"Not Weird\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Input: 8**\n",
        "   - 8 is even and between 6 and 20.\n",
        "   - Output: \"Weird\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Input: 22**\n",
        "   - 22 is even and greater than 20.\n",
        "   - Output: \"Not Weird\"\n",
        "\n",

        "In Python, the `.strip()` method is used to remove any leading (at the start) and trailing (at the end) whitespace characters (like spaces, tabs, or newline characters) from a string. This can be especially useful when processing input from users, as it ensures that any accidental spaces they might have included before or after their input do not affect the value being processed.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. `input()`: This function waits for the user to type some input and press Enter. It returns the input as a string.\n",
        "2. `.strip()`: This method is called on the string returned by `input()`. It removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the string.\n",
        "3. `int()`: The `strip()` method returns a string without any leading or trailing whitespace. This cleaned string is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.\n",

        "  # cleaned_string remains \"42\"\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use `.strip()`?\n",
        "Using `.strip()` ensures that if a user accidentally types extra spaces before or after their input, it won't cause an error when converting to an integer or comparing the string. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Without `.strip()`:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  n = int(input())\n",
        "  # User types \"  42  \"\n",
        "  # int(\"  42  \") raises a ValueError because of the spaces\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- With `.strip()`:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  n = int(input().strip())\n",
        "  # User types \"  42  \"\n",
        "  # \"  42  \".strip() results in \"42\"\n",
        "  # int(\"42\") successfully converts to 42\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "By ensuring the input is clean before conversion, `.strip()` helps prevent errors and makes the program more robust and user-friendly."
